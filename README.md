# Music-generation-using-deep-learning
This project focuses on generating music automatically using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN).Our input to the model is a sequence of musical events/notes. Our output will be new sequence of musical events/notes. In this case-study we have limited our self to single instrument music as this is our first cut model.
